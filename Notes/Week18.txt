Reminder (hard links and soft links): Hard and soft links are files (that are not really files) that point to other files. Windows'
shortcut files' equivalent in UNIX/Linux systems is soft links. Hard links are different dentries that point to the same inode. Soft
links point to different inodes.

In UNIX/Linux systems, in I-node based file systems, treat directories and files the same way. They are both stored on the disk the
same way. Whether an entry is a file or a directory is determined by a bit in the i_mode element of the inode struct. Over time, in
order to make searching faster, these informations were added to dentries as well. We can think of a directory as a file that consists
of dentries:

Contents of a directory file:

dentry
dentry
dentry
...

Remember that each directory has two default subdirectories, . and .. which respectively refers to itself and its parent. So a
directory, by default, will have two dentries inside it just by existing. The remaining dentries are the other subdirectories that are
created intentionally.

The term directory file is used here to emphasize the fact that the directories are also stored as files.

Dentries of directory files are not of equal length in i-node based file systems. That's because different files will have different
names and storing more bytes than necessary for the names would take up too much space.


This is declared in "fs/ext4/ext4.h":

    struct ext4_dir_entry_2 {
        __le32 inode;
        __le16 rec_len;
        __u8 name_len;
        __u8 file_type;
        char name[]; //Not null-terminated!
    };

Honestly just check the notes from the teacher's notes, so much stuff happened while the course was going on that I'm sure I cannot
keep up the notes with the remaining hours now even if I try.
